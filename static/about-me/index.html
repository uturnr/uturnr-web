            I've done quite a few different things in the aviation industry.
            I used to want to be a commercial pilot.
            I tried to be an air traffic controller.
            I've been responsible for training aviation support staff,
            and I am currently working in Human Resources and recently spent
            some time working in the Flight Operations department, leading
            improvements to our company's pilot scheduling and training tracking
            system. I have enjoyed my various roles, but I think where I can be
            the most useful (and happy!) is as a developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was 10 years old, I did some research on HTML and made my
            first website. It was about a book I was writing at the time.
            Shockingly, the site is still online at the free hosting
            service I used. The website is incredibly embarrassing and
            hilarious. I'm not feeling like allowing myself to be that
            vulnerable right now, so here is an incredibly tiny screenshot.

            Maybe I'll give you a peek if you hire me. ;)

          <p>
            When I was 12, I started my own little web design business. I ended
            up making websites for four local organizations using Flash and
            HTML. Those businesses have all either wisely upgraded their
            websites since then, or met their demise (hopefully not my fault).
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, I still do a little bit of freelance work in the web,
            graphic and video areas, and I always try to make use of my
            technical skills at work when I get a chance. Recently, I
            have been trying to upgrade my skillset, and I really want to work
            in a tech role. I have been building my competencies in the
            areas of web based applications, and I am eager to continue to
            learn more technologies and best practices. I am ready to hit
            the ground running and start bringing value immediately, while
            working hard to quickly fill gaps in my knowledge on my own time.
            A development role is where I feel I really belong. I still have
            much to learn, and I can't wait to get started!

              This is a fun side project I have been working on. It's still in
              the early development stages. The idea is that the bar owners
              and the general public can add and vote on their favourite bar
              specials in the area. Expect bugs! I
              am using React and Redux for this project (and loving it!).

              As a kid, I wrote a choose-your-own-adventure style story. I read
              the story at a <i>Grownups Read Things They Wrote As Kids</i> live
              event, and made a quick React-based site to showcase the story.

              When I was training for Air Traffic Control, I made a couple of
              simple games using the Phaser HTML5 framework. One was designed
              to help memorize bearings (within 5 degrees!) and distances
              for 46 waypoints in the vicinity of the fictional "March Airport".
              The other was to help practice the procedure for telling one
              aircraft about another's relative position. I reworked the games
              for the Regina airport during my on-the-job training.
